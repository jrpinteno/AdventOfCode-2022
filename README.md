# AdventOfCode-2022

I'm gonna be using this to relearn C++ (focusing on C++17) and data structures / algorithms. Hopefully I'll be able
to follow the rhythm. I don't expect to get the most optimal solution, just something that works (and day by day reducing
the awkwardness of coding in C++).

## Log
### Day 01
No surprises here since, being the first day, I expected it to be easy, coding wise. These first days will be used to gain back the C++ feel
after so many years and gather some of the utilities that will become useful for the following days.
